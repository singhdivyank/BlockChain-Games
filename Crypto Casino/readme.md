3. React- built a front end application through which user interacts with the blockchain
4. ChainLink- implements [randomness](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number/) for dice roll

**Technical Requirements**:
1. React.js
2. Solidity Programming Language
3. [Random Number Generation for Ethereum](https://blog.chain.link/random-number-generation-solidity/)
